# Keyworkd-Finder

## Project Status: Finished


**Goal:** 

part I:
- Automate computer to interact with the website and scrape the data this program goes through first 20pages of job listings for job inputted by the user.
- Collect information on title of position, experience level, company_name, employment_type, and job description, store into Non-relational database.

part II:
- From collected job descriptions, will separate into groups different experience level and for each group job descriptions will be tokenized, cleaned, and weighed appropriately. The cleaned data will be analyzed to show most important keywords both technical and non-technical for the job and its experience level.


**Why:**
- Many job-hunters do not really know what skills are required for the job they want to pursue. Instead of going through bunch of pages and reading each job descriptions this program will make your life easier. Just type the job name, learn all the required technical skills and other skills.



**Programs and Libraries used:**
Main code: Python(Splinter, Flask, BS4, NLTK, sklearn)
Visualization: javascript(d3, plotly), css3, html5, bootstrap4
Database: MongoDB
